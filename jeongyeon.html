    Jeongyeon was born on November 1, 1996 in Suwon, South Korea and was given the name Kyung-wan, at birth, due to being teased as a child, for this sounding like a boy's name, she legally changed her name to Jeong-yeon in the third grade. Her father is Yoo Chang-joon, who works as a chef for former president Kim Dae-jung, her mother's identity has not been revealed to the public. Jeongyeon has two older sisters, the eldest one is known professionally as Gong Seung-yeon and is an actress, the second eldest is named Yoo Seo-yeon and is an office worker. Jeongyeon trained to become a singer from a young age, and also learnt to play the trumpet and saxophone. Jeongyeon joined JYP Entertainment in JYP Entertainment's 6th Open Audition on March 1, 2010. Like Nayeon, Jihyo and Sana, JYP originally planned her to become a member of a girl group named 6Mix, but their debut was unfortunately cancelled. Jeongyeon made her breakthrough in 2015 as a contestant on the reality girl group survival show Sixteen and was finally chosen as a member of Twice. In 2014, she appeared with Nayeon in the music video of Got7's "Girls Girls Girls" and, in 2015, appeared in miss A's "Only You" music video.
